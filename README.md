# Video Game Basics
The purpose of this is to practice the basic hand-eye coordination necessary for playing video games (and eventually, typing).

The focus is on simple controls, one skill at a time, building up from looking at one hand's controls, to being able to control a character without looking at the controls, up to using two hands without looking.

There's no need to build anything, and the code will remain unminified for inspection.
